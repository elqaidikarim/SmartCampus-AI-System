### 🧠 Executive Summary

**SmartCampus** is a research-driven solution designed to digitize university management. It solves the issue of "Proxy Attendance" using a **Tri-Fold Authentication** mechanism: Face Recognition, Fingerprint Verification, and QR Code Scanning.

Beyond security, the system acts as a complete **Administrative Hub**, allowing staff to manage student records (Add, Update, Delete) and analyze attendance patterns to predict academic dropout risks.

### 🚀 Key Innovations

#### 1. Dual-Biometric Security 🔐
- Combines **Face Embeddings** (128-d vectors) with **Fingerprint Verification** to prevent identity spoofing.
- Includes **Liveness Detection** algorithms to ensure the user is physically present.

#### 2. Automated Student Administration 📁
- **Full CRUD Workflow:** Administrative tools to Insert, Select, Update, and Delete student profiles seamlessly.
- **Smart ID Integration:** Instantly generates professional Student ID Cards with unique QR Codes linked to the database.

#### 3. Predictive Analytics 📊
- Visualizes absenteeism trends by department and module.
- Alerts administration about "At-Risk" students exceeding absence thresholds using statistical thresholds.
