### 🧠 Executive Summary

**SmartCampus** is a research-driven solution designed to digitize university management. It solves the issue of "Proxy Attendance" using a **Tri-Fold Authentication** mechanism: Face Recognition, Fingerprint Verification, and **QR Code Scanning**.

Beyond security, the system acts as an administrative hub, automatically generating **Printable Student ID Cards** and analyzing attendance data to predict academic dropout risks.

### 🚀 Key Innovations

#### 1. Dual-Biometric Security 🔐
- Combines **Face Embeddings** (128-d vectors) with **Fingerprint Verification** to prevent identity spoofing.
- Includes **Liveness Detection** algorithms to ensure the user is physically present.

#### 2. Smart ID Card Generator 🆔
- **Automated Design:** Instantly generates professional Student ID Cards containing personal info and a unique **QR Code**.
- **QR Integration:** The QR code links directly to the student's digital profile for rapid library access or exam entry scanning.

#### 3. Predictive Analytics 📊
- Visualizes absenteeism trends by department and module.
- Alerts administration about "At-Risk" students exceeding absence thresholds using statistical thresholds.
